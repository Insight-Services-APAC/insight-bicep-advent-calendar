## Welcome

Welcome to the Azure Bicep advent calendar! The Bicep advent calendar is a series of blog posts that will be published daily throughout December 2023. The journey will start at the very basics of Bicep and progress to more advanced topics and the deployment of an azure landing zone using GitHub Actions and Bicep that can be used to host various applications and workloads. Finally, we will look at some features that are in preview or currently experimental to see whats coming in 2024.

## Background

For the last couple of years I have wanted to contribute to the community initiative around taking the concept of an advent calendar to provide blog posts and content around Azure capabilities and services throughout the month of December to help people learn about Azure. I have always struggled to find the time to commit to the initiative and have always been too late to the party to get involved. This year I have decided to take the plunge and commit to delivering something to the community. I have chosen to focus on Bicep as I have been working with it for the last 18 months and have been really impressed with the language and the community that has grown around it. I hope that this series of posts will help people get started with Bicep and provide some useful content & tips and tricks along the way.

## Azure Bicep Advent Calendar Schedule

The schedule for the Bicep Advent Calendar is shown below. The schedule will be updated daily with links to the posts as they are published. The schedule is subject to change as the month progresses and I may add additional posts if I have time.
