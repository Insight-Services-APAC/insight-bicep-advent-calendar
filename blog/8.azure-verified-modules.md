## Introduction

Azure Verified Modules (AVM) is a new initiative to consolidate and define platform engineering standards for Infrastructure as Code. AVM is planned to be a common code base for both Bicep and Terraform modules and toolkit for all to leverage (customers, partners and Microsoft). The goal is to provide a consistent and reliable way to deploy Azure resources and services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and help accelerate consistent solution development.
