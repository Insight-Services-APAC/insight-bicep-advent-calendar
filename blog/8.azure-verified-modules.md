## Introduction

In the prior post, we looked at how to consume a Bicep module from a centralised Private Bicep Registry using ACR. In this post, we will look at how we can achieve the same consumption of modules without the need to manage a Private Bicep Registry and your own modules.

## Azure Verified Modules

Azure Verified Modules (AVM) is a new initiative to consolidate and define platform engineering standards for Infrastructure as Code. AVM is planned to be a common code base for both Bicep and Terraform modules and a toolkit for all to leverage (customers, partners and Microsoft). The goal is to provide a consistent and reliable way to deploy Azure resources and services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and help accelerate consistent solution development.

Azure Verified Modules provides two types of modules: `Resource` and `Pattern` modules.

AVM modules are used to deploy Azure resources and their extensions, as well as reusable architectural patterns consistently.

Modules are composable building blocks that encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to one task.

- Flexible, generalized, multi-purpose
- Integrates child resources
- Integrates extension resources

More details on the initiative, including the *What, Why and How* can be found at the [Azure Verified Modules](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/) repository.
