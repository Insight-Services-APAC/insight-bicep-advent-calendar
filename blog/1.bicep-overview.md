## Introduction

In this blog post, we will explore what Bicep is and what benefits it brings to Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## What is Bicep?

 Bicep is a DSL that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. In a Bicep file, you define the infrastructure you want to deploy to Azure, and then use that file throughout the development lifecycle to repeatedly deploy your infrastructure. Your resources are deployed in a consistent manner. Bicep provides concise syntax, reliable type safety, and support for code reuse. Bicep also offers a first-class authoring experience for your IaC solutions in Azure, with rich features such as intellisense, syntax validation, and refactoring.

Bicep is compatible with all resource types and API versions for Azure services. As soon as a resource provider introduces new resource types and API versions, you can use them in your Bicep file. You donâ€™t have to wait for tools to be updated before using the new services. Bicep is also interoperable with existing ARM templates. You can decompile any ARM template into a Bicep file, and vice versa, as well as use Bicep modules to reference and reuse existing ARM templates.

## What benefits does Bicep bring to Infrastructure as Code?

Bicep brings several benefits to IaC, including:

- **Simple Syntax:** When compared to the equivalent JSON template, Bicep files are more concise and easier to read. Bicep requires no previous knowledge of programming languages. Bicep syntax is declarative and specifies which resources and resource properties you want to deploy.

The following examples show the difference between a Bicep file and the equivalent JSON template. Both examples deploy a storage account.

***Bicep***

```Bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location
param storageAccountName string = 'toylaunch${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'

resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  properties: {
    accessTier: 'Hot'
  }
}
```

***JSON***

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
    },
    "storageAccountName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[format('toylaunch{0}', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
    }
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2021-06-01",
      "name": "[parameters('storageAccountName')]",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_LRS"
      },
      "kind": "StorageV2",
      "properties": {
        "accessTier": "Hot"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the Bicep file is much shorter and clearer than the JSON template. Bicep eliminates the need for brackets, quotes, commas, and other syntactic noise that can make JSON templates hard to read and maintain.

- **Authoring Experience:** When you use the Bicep Extension for VS Code or Visual Studio to create your Bicep files, you get a first-class authoring experience. The editor provides rich type-safety, intellisense, and syntax validation. You can also create Bicep files in Visual Studio with the Bicep extension for Visual Studio. These features help you write correct and consistent Bicep code, and avoid common errors and typos. You can also use the Bicep CLI to compile, decompile, and validate your Bicep files from the command line.

- **Repeatable results:** Repeatedly deploy your infrastructure throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent manner. Bicep files are idempotent, meaning that you can run the same Bicep file multiple times and get the same result. Bicep also supports what-if deployment, which allows you to preview the changes that will be made to your resources before deploying them.

- **Code reuse:** Bicep supports modularization and parameterization, which enable you to reuse your Bicep code across different scenarios and environments. You can define Bicep modules to encapsulate a set of related resources, and then reference them from other Bicep files. You can also define parameters to customize your Bicep files for different inputs and values. Bicep modules can also reference existing ARM templates, so you can leverage your existing IaC investments.

## Conclusion

Bicep is a new language for IaC that simplifies the creation and deployment of Azure resources. Bicep offers a simple syntax, a rich authoring experience, repeatable results, and code reuse. Bicep is compatible with all Azure services and existing ARM templates. Bicep is easy to learn and use, and can help you accelerate your DevOps journey in Azure.

Next, we will look at how to get started with Bicep, including the required tooling and some best practices that will help along the way.
