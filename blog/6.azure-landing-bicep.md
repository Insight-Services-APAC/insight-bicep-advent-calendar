## Introduction

An Azure Landing Zone is a way of designing and deploying cloud resources in Azure following best practices and guidelines. It helps you to migrate, modernize, and innovate your applications in a scalable and secure manner. An Azure Landing Zone consists of two types of subscriptions: platform landing zones and application landing zones. Platform landing zones provide shared services such as identity, connectivity, and management to the application landing zones. Application landing zones host the workloads themselves and can be customized for different needs.

We are going to focus on an application landing zone, which is a subscription that is dedicated to hosting a specific application or workload. It is a self-contained environment that is isolated from other subscriptions. It is designed to host a single application or workload and is managed by a single team. It is also designed to be scalable and secure.
