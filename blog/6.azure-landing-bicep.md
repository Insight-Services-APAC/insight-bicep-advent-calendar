## Introduction

## Overview

The associated modules are designed to accelerate deployment of Application Landing Zones (aka Azure Subscriptions) within an Azure AD Tenant using a repeatable process (aka Vending Machine).

The process diagram below outlines the deployment provisioning for a Landing Zone.

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

The modules are designed to be instantiated many times, once for each desired landing zone. This is currently split logically into the following capabilities:

- Subscription Creation and placement into the desired Management Group
- Subscription Tags
- Resource Group Tags
- Subscription Role assignments
- Subscription Azure Budget
- Common Resource Groups `alertsRG`, `NetworkWatcherRG`, `ascExportRG`
- Action Group in the `alertsRG` Resource Group
- Network Watcher instance in the `NetworkWatcherRG` Resource Group
- Network Resource Group for spoke networking resources, including
  - Virtual Network and associated Subnets
  - Network Security Groups
  - Route Tables
  - Hub & spoke connectivity (peering to a hub Virtual Network)
  - Virtual WAN connectivity (peering to a Virtual Hub via a Virtual Hub Connection)

$Location = 'australiaeast' # Region of the deployment
$ManagementGroupId = 'mg-alz' # Set this to the Management Group Id you wish to target the deployment against. NOTE: This isn't the Management Group that the Subscription will be moved to, that is specified via the parameter file.
$TemplateFile = '..\orchestration\main.bicep' # Path to the Module.
$TemplateParameterFile = '..\configuration\sub-sap-prd-01.parameters.json' # Path to the Parameter File.'
