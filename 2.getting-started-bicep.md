## Introduction

In this blog post, we will install Bicep, extensions and other tool sets that are required to get started with developing templates. This [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install) will go through the steps to install the Bicep tooling and extensions, we also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Tooling and Extensions

The following is a list of VSCode extensions that I find useful when developing Bicep templates.

- [CodeTour extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour)
- [ARM Tools extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools)
- [ARM Template Viewer extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bencoleman.armview)
- [PSRule extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bewhite.psrule-vscode)
- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

## Bicep Best Practices

Now that we have installed the tooling and extensions, let's take a look at some of the best practices that we should follow when developing Bicep templates. Some of these best practices might not be clear straight away, but as you progress through your authoring journey it will make your templates more readable and maintainable

### Parameters

- Use good naming for parameter declarations. Good names make your templates easy to read and understand. Make sure you're using clear, descriptive names, and be consistent in your naming.
- Use the `@allowed` decorator sparingly as you might block valid deployments. As Azure services add SKUs and sizes, your allowed list will need to be updated.
- Use descriptions for parameters. Try to make the descriptions helpful, and provide any important information about what the template needs the parameter values to be.
- Parameter declarations can exist anywhere in the template file, although it's usually a good idea to put them at the top of the file so your Bicep code is easy to read.
- Use minimum and maximum character length for parameters that control naming as this will help avoid errors later during deployment.

### Variables

- Unlike parameters, when using variables the [data type](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-resource-manager/bicep/data-types.md) are required
- Bicep functions can be used to create a variables, this is helpful when you need to create a variable that is a combination of other variables or parameters.
- Once a variable is defined in the template, you reference the value using the variable's name.
- Use variables for hardcoded values that donâ€™t change between deployments, and use parameters for values that change between deployments.

### Names

- Use lower camel case for names, such as `variableName` or `myResource`.
- The [uniqueString() function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-functions-string#uniquestring) is useful for creating unique resource names. When you provide the same parameters, it returns the same string every time.
- It's a good practice to use template expressions to create resource names, like in this example:

```bicep
param appServicePlanPrefix string = 'asp'
param locationPrefix string = 'syd'
param environmentPrefix string = 'prd'
param appServicePlanName string = '${appServicePlanPrefix}-${locationPrefix}-${environmentPrefix}-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'

```

- Strings generated by `uniqueString()` aren't meaningful. It's helpful to use a template expression to create a name that includes meaningful information.
- The `uniqueString()` function doesn't guarantee globally unique names. By adding additional text to your resource names, you reduce the likelihood of reusing an existing resource name. Useful for things like Azure storage accounts that are globally unique.
- Sometimes the `uniqueString()` function creates strings that start with a number. Some Azure resources, like storage accounts, don't allow their names to start with numbers. Adding a prefix to this helps control the naming more.
- Many Azure resource types have rules about the allowed characters and length of their names. Embedding the creation of resource names in the template means that anyone who uses the template doesn't have to remember to follow these rules themselves.

### Resource definitions

- Don't embed complex expressions directly into resource properties, this clutters resource definitions with logic. Use variables for these expressions instead as this approach makes your code easier to read and understand.
- Use the latest API version for each resource where possible, this ensures that you have access to the latest features and fixes.
- Use implicit dependencies over explicit dependencies, the `dependsOn` resource property enables you to declare an explicit dependency between resources, it's usually possible to use the other resource's properties by using its symbolic name. This approach creates an implicit dependency between the two resources, and enables Bicep to manage the relationship itself.
- Use the `existing` keyword when a resource isn't deployed in the Bicep file, this allows you to use the symbolic reference for the resource.

```bicep
// Resource: Azure Firewall Policy (Existing)
resource firewallPolicy 'Microsoft.Network/firewallPolicies@2022-07-01' existing = {
  name: parentName
}

// Resource: Rule Collection Group
resource ruleCollectionGroup 'Microsoft.Network/firewallPolicies/ruleCollectionGroups@2022-07-01' = {
  name: 'ruleCollectionGroup'
  parent: firewallPolicy
  properties: {}
}

```

### Outputs

- Don't create outputs for sensitive data, these can be accessed via the deployment history.

## Conclusion

So now we understand a little about Bicep and the benefits it brings, we have installed the required tooling and extensions and have a good understanding of some of the best practices that we should follow when developing Bicep templates. Finally, we have some useful links to help us on our journey. Tomorrow we will look into the various elements and structure of a Bicep template.
