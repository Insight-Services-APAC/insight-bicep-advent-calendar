## What is an Azure Landing Zone - Vending Machine

The associated artifacts in this repository are designed to accelerate deployment of an Azure Landing Zones within a Microsoft Entra tenant using a repeatable process (aka Vending Machine). Effectively, it allows you to deploy a subscription and key resources in it very quickly.

The process diagram below outlines the provisioning process.

The solution is designed to be instantiated many times, once for each
desired landing zone. This is split logically into the following capabilities:

- Subscription creation and placement into the desired Management Group
- Subscription tags
- Resource group tags
- Subscription role assignments
- Subscription budget
- Common resource groups `alertsRG`, `NetworkWatcherRG`, `ascExportRG`
- Action group in the `alertsRG` resource group
- Network watcher instance in the `NetworkWatcherRG` resource group
- Network resource group for spoke networking resources, including
  - Virtual network and associated subnets
  - Network security groups
  - Route tables
  - Hub & spoke connectivity (peering to a hub virtual network)
  - Virtual WAN connectivity (peering to a virtual hub via a virtual hub connection)
- Resource providers and resource providers features registration
